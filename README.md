# AI Data Lab

Welcome to **AI Data Lab**!  

I’m **Francis Matu**, a student and aspiring AI professional exploring the world of **data annotation, dataset engineering, and deep learning**. This repository is my personal lab where I practice hands-on AI workflows, from annotating datasets to learning PyTorch and preparing datasets for model training.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Lane Detection
- **Dataset source:** Kaggle Autonomous Driving Dataset  
- **Task:** Annotating lanes, road boundaries, and pedestrian crossings  
- **Tool:** CVAT  
- **Work done:** Annotated 500+ images and exported in **YOLO** and **COCO** formats  
- **Screenshots:** See `lane-detection/screenshots`  

### 2. Object Detection
- **Dataset source:** Open-source traffic dataset  
- **Task:** Annotating vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles  
- **Tool:** CVAT  
- **Work done:** Annotated 300+ images, exported in multiple formats  
- **Screenshots:** See `object-detection/screenshots`  

### 3. PyTorch Learning
- **Goal:** Understanding PyTorch basics for AI model training  
- **Content:** Sample scripts and notebooks exploring tensors, datasets, and simple neural networks  
- **Folder:** `pytorch-learning/notebooks`

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data annotation using **CVAT** and **LabelImg**  
- Annotation formats: **COCO**, **YOLO**, **Pascal VOC**  
- Python: JSON handling, dataset preprocessing, basic scripting  
- AI frameworks: **PyTorch** (beginner)  
- Version control with **Git/GitHub**  
- Attention to detail and quality assurance  


## About Me
I am currently a student at **Multimedia University of Kenya**, pursuing a degree in **Applied Physics and Computer Science**. Apart from that, I am learning **AI and data annotation**. My goal is to grow from an annotator to a **dataset engineer and AI practitioner**, building datasets and pipelines for real-world machine learning projects.

This repository is a reflection of my learning journey and practical experience.
